## 📌 Background & Overview

**Objective:**

**📖 What is this project about?**

- The Marketing team aims to launch personalized campaigns to enhance customer retention and acquisition during the holiday season. However, because the dataset is large, manual segmentation is no longer efficient.
- To solve this, the **RFM (Recency–Frequency–Monetary) model** is applied using **Python (Google Colab)** to classify customers based on past purchasing behavior.
- This project includes:
  - Data cleaning & preparation  
  - RFM score calculation  
  - Customer segmentation  
  - Visualization  
  - Actionable business recommendations  

**👤 Who is this project for?**
- Marketing & Sales Department  
- Business stakeholders & decision-makers 

**🔍 Why use RFM?**

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a customer analytics technique used to evaluate purchasing behavior and categorize customers into meaningful segments. Each customer receives a score based on the three RFM dimensions, helping businesses identify high-value audiences for targeted marketing and sales strategies.

- **Recency:** Measures how long it has been since the customer's last purchase.  
- **Frequency:** Evaluates how often the customer makes purchases.  
- **Monetary:** Calculates the total amount spent by the customer.

By applying RFM, businesses can segment customers based on their value, allowing them to personalize campaigns, prioritize high-value groups, and improve customer engagement strategies.
